In this task we will be using linear regression algorithm to predict the prices of the houses. the dataset used is Boston housing dataset which is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. I have used to jupyter notebook to do the coding because it is an interactive way to show the code and the following output.

I will be providing the dataset and jupyter code and the complete python in the above predicting house prices
