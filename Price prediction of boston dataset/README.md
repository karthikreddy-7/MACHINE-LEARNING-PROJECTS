# Predicting house prices

Predicting house prices is a common task in the field of machine learning and data analysis. The objective is to build a model that can predict the price of a house based on its features, such as the number of bedrooms, the size of the house, the location, and other relevant factors.

To predict house prices, a regression model is typically used. There are different types of regression models, but linear regression is the most commonly used method for predicting house prices. Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (the house price) and one or more independent variables (the features).

## Data collection:

Collecting data on houses and their features, such as the number of bedrooms, size, location, and other relevant factors.
## Data preprocessing:

Cleaning and preprocess the data to remove any missing values or irrelevant data, outliers detection and performing feature engineering to select the most relevant features.
## Data splitting:

Spliting the data into training and testing datasets. The training dataset will be used to train the regression model, while the testing dataset will be used to evaluate the performance of the model.
## Model training and Evaluation:

Training a regression model, such as a linear regression model, on the training dataset. The model will learn to predict the house prices based on the features of the houses in the training dataset.
Using the testing dataset to evaluate the performance of the regression model. Metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared can be used to evaluate the performance of the model.
## Model optimization and deployment:

Optimizing the regression model to improve its performance. This can involve hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or other techniques.


Once the regression model is optimized, it can be deployed in production to predict the prices of new houses based on their features.
## Boston Housing Dataset

This information was formerly a part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository but has since been deleted. Additionally, the scikit-learn library includes this data. This data set consists of 506 samples and 13 feature variables. Using the provided features, the goal is to estimate the house's value.

Following is a description of every feature:

CRIM: 
Per capita crime rate by town

ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft

INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town

CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)

RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers

RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways

TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000

B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)Â², where Bk is the proportion of [people of African American descent] by town

LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population

MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
